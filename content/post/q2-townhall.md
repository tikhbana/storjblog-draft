## Our next quarterly town hall is just around the corner. Everyone in our community is welcome to join the meeting, which we will live stream and make accessible worldwide.

<p>
In this meeting, hear from Ben Golub, our executive chairman and interim CEO, Shawn Wilkinson, co-founder and chief strategy officer, and JT Olio, director of engineering. Topics include an update on Storj, product development news, progress toward releasing the updated v.3 network architecture, and farmer payouts. Presentations will last about 20 minutes, and there will be lots of room for Q&A. Please send questions you’d like us to address to townhall@storj.io.

This is your chance to give us feedback and discuss topics related to Storj and our community. We’ll record the town hall meeting. If you can’t join us live, you can watch the replay later on the Storj Labs YouTube channel.
